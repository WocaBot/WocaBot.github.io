It simply solve WocaBee, what more do you want?

Project is currently in *beta*, if you found any bug submit it into [Issues Page](https://github.com/WocaBot/WocaBot-Releases/issues) on our Github.

Use it on your own risk, because WocaBee theoretically can detect using of this script, but more likely they just watch the time you spend doing it and how many points you got.
